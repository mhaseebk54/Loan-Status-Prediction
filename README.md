# Loan-Status-Prediction


This project predicts the approval status of loan applications using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm. The dataset includes applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, and employment information.

Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values.

Encoded categorical features.

Performed feature scaling for model optimization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized data distributions and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Identified patterns in credit history, income, and loan status.

Modeling with SVM:

Trained a Support Vector Machine classifier to predict loan approval.

Evaluated performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

Results

The SVM model successfully classified loan approval status with strong predictive accuracy, demonstrating the applicability of machine learning in financial decision-making.
